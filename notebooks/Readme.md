## Overview

Each notebook in this directory is designed to help you understand and implement different machine learning algorithms. They include detailed explanations, code, and visualizations to make learning easier and more interactive.

## Notebooks

Here is a list of the available notebooks along with a brief description of each:

- **Linear Regression Example**: Demonstrates how to perform linear regression using a simple dataset.
- **Logistic Regression Example**: Shows how to use logistic regression for binary classification.
- **Decision Tree Example**: Explains the implementation of a decision tree classifier.
- **Random Forest Example**: Illustrates the use of a random forest for classification tasks.
- **SVM Example**: Shows how to implement a Support Vector Machine for classification.
- **KNN Example**: Demonstrates the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification.
- **K-Means Clustering Example**: Explains how to perform K-Means clustering.
- **PCA Example**: Demonstrates Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.
- **Neural Network Example**: Shows how to build and train a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Gradient Boosting Example**: Illustrates the use of gradient boosting for classification tasks.

## Getting Started

To use the notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. If you haven't already, you can install Jupyter by following the instructions below.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have all the required Python packages installed. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the root directory of this repository:

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

## Running the Notebooks

To run the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:

    ```bash
    cd notebooks
    ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. From here, you can select and run any of the notebooks.

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, so you can run them independently of each other. Follow the instructions within each notebook to understand and execute the code.
